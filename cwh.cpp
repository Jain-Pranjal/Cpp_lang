// the substr returns the new string and it takes 2 parameter  pos and len

// pointer is a specialtype of variable that store the address of the other variable 
// oops basiaclly is a techniqe of doing  the programming in this we creaet the template of the object which is a real world entity and we make the class for that 
// it basically enable use for DRY principal


// making a object

}
// first we have to include the preprocessor directive to use the basic funciton in the header files 
// so bascially we need to use the using namespace std everytime as we need to define the variable name 
// the execution starts from the main function itslef 
// string is a datatype that is not built in so we need to import that and it is enclosed in " " 
// for the characters it is enclosed in ' ' single inverted commas 
// so for the string we need to import the string header file

// the various type of integer datatype is 
// short int long longlong 

// if we want the value to get not changes then we can use the const keyword 
// float double longDouble are the decimal datatypes 



// if we dont usde the break in the switch statement then all the cases will get on and all will get done also 

/*
what are arrays 
they basically store the same type of datatypr 

it is not necessary to define the size off the array but for our undestanding we provde the size */

// if we want to do the typecasting just put any datatype in the (int)
