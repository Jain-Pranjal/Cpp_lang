// Function quick revision 
// so we create the declaration of the function above the maina nd do the defination of the function after the main 
// we call the function inside the main parameter 

// the funciton defination contains the parameter and the function call contains the argumnet in it 

details("pranjal","kumar","jain",20);

// so the function takes the parameter n it and do th computing with those parameter and we pass the argumentin it during the function call

// RETURN value of the function 
// keep in mind that the return type must be same datatype of the function type and we can store the value of the function return in the variable also

// Function Overlaoding means that we can create as many as function having the same name with diff parameter 
// a functioncan be overlaod by changing the number of the parameters or the by changing the datatype of the parameter 


// function overloading means that function with the same name but diff parameter in it 
// function overriding means having same name , same parameter , same return type but we can change the defination of the function means we can change what a function do and this is called the function overriding 
// function overriding is done in inheritence 

// we use the fucntion overloadig becasue that instead of using the 2 diff function for the same thing we can overlaod it only 
// same name but diff parameter
// multiple function can have the same name but diff parameter and this is called the function overloading 


// RECURSION 
// BASICALY WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE BASE CONDITION FOR IT TO STOP 

int result=sum(10);
cout<<"the sum is "<<result<<"\n";

// we use the strucutre in the C lang and in C++ we use the class and objects

// in the oops concept we creae the class and the objects 
// so basically we reate the class and then we make the objects out of the class 
// class is basically is a template and with the template we can create the objects so that we need not to make the each again and again variable 
// with the obejcts we make the real world enetity and we use the dot operator to make them from the class 


// class is basically a template and without the object instantiation no mwmory is not  allocated to the class
// so after the class we need to make the object so that we can use the template of the class
// class bascilly contains the variable knows as attributes and functions knowns as methods in it and we can access them by using the dot operator with the object making 
// so in the class we make the variable and th emethods in it 

// so when the object is created then it inherited all the variables and the methods of the class in it and can acces it by using th edo toperator 
// we can make as many as the object with a single class and can change the value also 


myclass myobj;
myobj.name="pranjal jain";
myobj.num=20;
// object is been created and now we can access it and the memory is been given to the class 
cout<<"the name is "<<myobj.name<<" and the age is "<<myobj.num<<"\n";


// we can make as many as the object from a single class 
// myclass myobj2;  //declare the 2nd object from the same class
// string name=myobj2.name="pj";
// cout<<"then name has been changed to : "<<name<<"\n";

// so in this way we create the real world entities 

// moreover we can also add fucntion in the class defination 
// there are 2 ways through which we can add the fucntion inside or outside the class 


myclass2 myobj2;
myobj2.myfun("pranjal jain \n");

// so in this way we use the function inside the class 
// so the class methods can be declare both inside and outside the function 
// so make the class and make the function inside the function 


// if we want to dfine the function outisde the class the first we had to declare it into the class and then we can use the :: for outisde define 
// declare it inside thefun so that we can access it by the dot operator 


// now we can also use the construcutor that is a special type of method which runs itself on the time of the object creation 
// we can badically use the construcutor to pass the value at the time of the object creation only .




// CONSTRUCUTOR HAS THE SAME NAME AS THE CLASS NAME 
// construcutor always havve the same name as the class name and it does not have any return value and it is always public 

car objconst("bmw","c class",5);
// here the const takes the value and store in the varibale 
// so just by making the object the construcutor is already called and do the thing that is define in it .
// constructor is the function so we need to use the ()
cout<<objconst.brand<<"\n";

// construcutor is also a funciton so we can drfine it outisde the class also 
// for defining it outisde the class we need to use the scope resolution operator in it 

// objconst.fun1();

// we have by default private members in the class


// accessng a private member of a class
demo mydemo;
// mydemo.age=66;
// this is inaccesaable as we cannot acces the private members



// Working with the files
// use the f stream lib 

//fstream can be used for both read , wriite and create of the fiel 


// fstream can do both the write read and crete the file so it is a combination of them 

fstream Myfile("sample.txt");
Myfile<<"hello this is a sample file in c++\n hemlo sabhi kpo ";
Myfile.close();

// for the string we use the get line function to take the string 
// getline() is sed to read the lienof text


/*

string sample;
cout<<"enter the name : ";
// it terminates the white space charater 
// thats why we use the getline() function 
// cin>>sample;
getline(cin,sample);
// cin takes the input ans store inside the sample variable 
// getline finction is used for the same for reading the text line by line 

cout<<sample;

*/

// reading from a file 
string text;
fstream f ("sample.txt");
//  f is the alias of the file name 
while(getline(f,text));
cout<<text;
f.close();


// Inheritence
// so basiclly we make the class from the baseclass or the parent class 
gaddi car;  //object maing 
cout<<"\n"<<car.brand<<"\n";
// accesisg the fun
car.honk();
