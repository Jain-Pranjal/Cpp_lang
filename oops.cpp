// we make the class here above the main function

    public:

int main(){
// Function quick revision 
// so we create the declaration of the function above the maina nd do the defination of the function after the main 
// we call the function inside the main parameter 

// the funciton defination contains the parameter and the function call contains the argumnet in it 

details("pranjal","kumar","jain",20);

// so the function takes the parameter n it and do th computing with those parameter and we pass the argumentin it during the function call

// RETURN value of the function 
// keep in mind that the return type must be same datatype of the function type and we can store the value of the function return in the variable also

// Function Overlaoding means that we can create as many as function having the same name with diff parameter 
// a functioncan be overlaod by changing the number of the parameters or the by changing the datatype of the parameter 


// function overloading means that function with the same name but diff parameter in it 
// function overriding means having same name , same parameter , same return type but we can change the defination of the function means we can change what a function do and this is called the function overriding 
// function overriding is done in inheritence 

// we use the fucntion overloadig becasue that instead of using the 2 diff function for the same thing we can overlaod it only 
// same name but diff parameter
// multiple function can have the same name but diff parameter and this is called the function overloading

// BASICALY WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE BASE CONDITION FOR IT TO STOP

// we use the strucutre in the C lang and in C++ we use the class and objects

// in the oops concept we creae the class and the objects 
// so basically we reate the class and then we make the objects out of the class 
// class is basically is a template and with the template we can create the objects so that we need not to make the each again and again variable 
// with the obejcts we make the real world enetity and we use the dot operator to make them from the class 


// class is basically a template and without the object instantiation no mwmory is not  allocated to the class
// so after the class we need to make the object so that we can use the template of the class
// class bascilly contains the variable knows as attributes and functions knowns as methods in it and we can access them by using the dot operator with the object making 
// so in the class we make the variable and th emethods in it 

// so when the object is created then it inherited all the variables and the methods of the class in it and can acces it by using th edo toperator 
// we can make as many as the object with a single class and can change the value also 


myclass myobj;
myobj.name="pranjal jain";
myobj.num=20;
// object is been created and now we can access it and the memory is been given to the class 
cout<<"the name is "<<myobj.name<<" and the age is "<<myobj.num<<"\n";


// we can make as many as the object from a single class 
myclass myobj2;  //declare the 2nd object from the same class
string name=myobj2.name="pj";
cout<<"then name has been changed to : "<<name<<"\n";

// so in this way we create the real world entities
